# Heart Stroke Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a stroke in an individual based on health and demographic data. This model aims to assist in early detection and preventive healthcare planning.


## 🧠 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases, especially strokes, are among the leading causes of death globally. This project uses machine learning to predict the possibility of a stroke based on input features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and more.


## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and sourced from **[Kaggle - Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)**.


## Key Features:
- `gender`
- `age`
- `hypertension`
- `heart_disease`
- `ever_married`
- `work_type`
- `Residence_type`
- `avg_glucose_level`
- `bmi`
- `smoking_status`
- `stroke` (target: 1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)
